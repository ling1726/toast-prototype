## Lacking
- ✅ no support for multi-window
- ✅ newestOnTop should become 'newestClosestToCentre'
- different toast boundaries
- no support for priorities
- slot code are still in the hooks
- separate between hooks/components/DOM could be better/leaner
  - classNames
  - progress bar
  - theme
- uses findDOMNode
- no tests
- autoClose named timeout

## Scenarios
- ✅ basic
- ✅ maximum number of toasts
- ✅ button to dismiss toast
- ✅ middle toast dismissing earlier based on timeout
- ✅ middle toast dismissing earlier based on button
- ✅ dismiss all toasts 
- ✅ different positions
- different toast boundaries
- priority toasts
- pause on blur
- sliding after middle toast is dismissed
