## Lacking
- [DONE] no support for multi-window
- no support for priorities
- slot code are still in the hooks
- separate between hooks/components/DOM could be better/leaner
  - classNames
  - progress bar
  - theme
- uses findDOMNode
- no tests

## Scenarios
- basic
- maximum number of toasts
- button to dismiss toast
- middle toast dismissing based on timeout
- middle toast dismissing based on button
- dismiss all toasts 
- different toast boundaries
- priority toasts
- pause on blur
